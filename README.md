Castlevania 2
For this project i plan on adding castlevania elements to the game.

This will include

1. Whip as main weapon plus sub weapons

2. Movement changes:ex backdash, slide, superjump

3. Include magic system

4. Collectables

Completed:
1. Whip as main weapon plus 2 more weapons, bottle and axe mapped to 2 and 3.
2. Added 2 movement types. Backdash can be done by binding "give backdash" and super jump "give superjump"
3. Both the bottle and axe have special item crashes like in game. can be binded by command "give magic" Magic system drains more hearts allocated to sub weapons.
4. After killing enemies they drop hearts.
